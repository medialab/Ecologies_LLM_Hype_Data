So in theory, LLMs could help gain time for that. But in practice, I don't think that's what's happening. Because now that we can do more complex things with machines, we end up pushing the tools even further. And in the end, I don't think we actually spend more time trying to really understand the mechanisms at stake. We just want a fancy method that will impress people.
