Because now that we can do more complex things with machines, we end up pushing the tools even further. And in the end, I don't think we actually spend more time trying to really understand the mechanisms at stake. We just want a fancy method that will impress people. So it's true, it expands possibilities a lot for economists. But is that really what we should be doing?",
