1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,750
But not all uses were simple substitutions.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:10,952
Some participants relied on what LLMs were good at, depending on what they picked up from the media, friends, or colleagues.

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:15,234
Nearly everyone used ChatGPT to paraphrase.

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:24,937
Using it for coding purposes was also widespread, justified by the idea that it's good at it, because they had heard that it had been trained on lots of code.

5
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:31,481
Yet for them, coding was mostly seen as a means to achieve a more valuable end.

6
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,423
It didn't need to be elegant.

7
00:00:33,802 --> 00:00:35,363
It just needed to be functional.

8
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:40,887
Constance said she didn't care if her code was pretty or fast, only that it ran.

9
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:45,890
Tobias went further, rejecting the idea of coding as creative work.

10
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,460
I think for me, it's more like implementing something I've already set out.

11
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:56,404
I did my research design, so I kind of mapped out the process of data collection or data analysis.

12
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:03,807
It feels like I've already put the thought into how I wanted to do it, and then I just tell it, chat GPT, to implement.

13
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:11,757
Participants also built on the existing division of labor in their line of work to assign tasks to the LLM.

14
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:18,981
As such, researchers quickly sought to test the accuracy of literature reviews or bibliography management.

15
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:28,867
Yinxin found ChatGPT incredibly efficient, especially in the writing of quantitative social science essays, since they tend to be standard in format.

16
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:35,974
At the same time, Charlotte noticed that they're quite good when it comes to referencing with rigid guidelines.

17
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:43,001
So if there's something really clear, like a formula for how to do referencing, for example, it usually can do that.

18
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:50,049
Most agreed that LLMs performed best on standardized tasks governed by precise rules.

19
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,165
Over time, however, participants began to push beyond these obvious use cases.

20
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:03,673
In law, for instance, Alice realized that what she thought of as a single task was too unwieldy for the LLM.

21
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:10,621
What felt like one smooth action to her had to be broken into smaller, more manageable steps.

22
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:19,724
I think one of the key things to get proper results is really to dissect every part of what you want to reflect on and go step by step.

23
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:27,068
Because even if you give the big picture at the beginning and then try to break it down, it tends to try to do everything at once.

24
00:02:27,587 --> 00:02:29,508
I mean, it was really confused.
